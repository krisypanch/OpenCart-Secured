OpenCart-Secured Readme:

This is a more secured version of OpenCart. I have created this project due the original developer doesn't understand web security and refuses to fix any of the security problems that are found.

If you find any security problems, and the original developer will not fix them then please feel to submit them to ben [at] visionsource [dot] org and I will be happy to fix them.

If you notice that this version isn't the latest the release then please email me and I will update the codebase to the latest version.

Note: It is still possible that this version is still vulnerable to security issues but haven't been found yet. The ultimate goal is to create a new E-Commerce application that is build on good coding practices, security and user feedback.
